    <h3>Buy A Ticket</h3>

    <p>The farebox at the front of the bus accepts cash fares and passes but does not provide change. Please have the exact fare ready, as bus operators cannot handle money or make change. Pennies and foreign objects are not accepted.</p>

    <li>
        Online: Visit https://www.go901transit.com/ or the MATA Go901 mobile app to buy your ticket. Choose your ticket type, enter your payment details, and you’ll receive an e-ticket instantly that you can show directly from your phone or email when boarding.</li>
    <li>
        At the Bus Station: Visit the ticket counter at your nearest bus station. The staff will assist you in selecting your route and ticket type, and you can pay using cash, credit, or debit card.
    </li>
    <li>
        Onboard: Some bus services allow you to purchase tickets directly from the driver, usually with cash. However, it’s recommended to buy your ticket in advance to avoid delays.
